It's just a experimental DIY project, where\r\neverybody can build her/his own individual transmitter. So everybody is responsible for their\r\nown build hardware. Do not make medical decisions based on the transmitters data!**\r\n\r\n![](http://picload.org/image/rgrrliwi/img_1005.jpg)\r\n\r\nWith the LimiTTer you are able to transform the FGM Libre system into a real Continous\r\nGlucose Monitoring System (CGMS). That means that you don't have to manually scan the \r\nsensor with the reader. The LimiTTer do this for you - every 5 minutes. It sends the\r\nglucose value to your smartphone which must have the [xDrip](http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/) app installed. xDrip is really\r\na great and matured app for Android. It can send the glucose values to your smartwatch or\r\nvia Nightscout into the cloud. The most important feature is to having a night guard.\r\n\r\nI have opened this project here because it's a invitation for all developers out there to\r\nimprove the code.\r\n\r\n![](http://picload.org/image/rgrrlpgw/img_1016.jpg)\r\n...the next days i will post the sketch for the Arduino UNO/pro-mini and the instructions to assemble\r\nthe hardware.\r\n",
