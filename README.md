# LimiTTer
Transmitter for the Freestyle Libre FGM system

With the LimiTTer you are able to transform the FGM Libre system into a real Continous
Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS). That means that you don't have to manually scan the 
sensor with the reader. The LimiTTer do this for you - every 5 minutes. It sends the
glucose value to your smartphone which must have the xDrip app installed. xDrip is really
a great and matured app for Android. It can send the glucose values to your smartwatch or
via Nightscout into the cloud. The most important feature is to having a night guard.

Please note, that LimiTTer is a experimental DIY project. You will built your own LimiTTer.
I have opened this project here because it's a invitation for all developers out there to
improve the LimiTTer.

...the next days i will post the code for the Arduino pro-mini and the instructions to assemble
the hardware.
